            <h2>Childhood Story</h2>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a <b><i>child</i></b>, I felt genuinely happy because I had no problems to worry about. I was not stressed back then, and I simply enjoyed my childhood. Basically a kid enjoying childhood. In my early childhood, I lived with my grandparents on my mother's side. I was very happy because I could spend a lot of time with my cousins. We shared the same vibe, so playing together always felt fun. Living in my grandparents' home taught me many important things in life. They taught me values that I knew would matter as I grew older. I still remember how I cried during my first day of kindergarten. I cried because I thought my mom would leave me alone. That moment made me realize that our parents cannot always stay by our side. It became the first time I learned how to stand on my own. I also loved waking up early every morning. Watching my favorite cartoons while eating breakfast became a routine for me. That simple habit felt like a very <b>Filipino</b> way to start the day. My mornings were always peaceful and full of comfort. I enjoyed those moments more than anything else at that age. My childhood may have been simple, but it was filled with happiness. Those early experiences shaped my personality in ways I still appreciate today. Looking back, I am grateful for the joy and lessons my childhood gave me.

            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my <b><i>teenage years</i></b>, I often felt a sense of kulang because of the pandemic. I grew up believing that my teenage life would be full of adventures and memories. Every day, I expected to learn something new, especially lessons I needed later in life. When I first entered high school, I thought it would be as dramatic and exciting as the movies. I imagined events, competitions, and moments that would change everything. But things turned out very different in real life, high school life felt like a roller coaster that kept going up and down without warning. It was fun at times because I met new friends and discovered new things about myself. It was scary during moments when I felt unprepared for challenges. It was confusing because I didn't always understand what I was feeling. It was also exciting because I could see myself growing and changing. But when the pandemic hit, everything shifted. I started feeling lonely, sad, and disconnected from the world. I felt like I was missing out on important teenage experiences. Most days, I stayed in my room doing nothing but playing games or watching shows. I felt stuck in a cycle that was slowly draining my motivation. One day, I decided that I needed to break that cycle. I tried doing something different so I could improve myself. I realized that if I spent all my teenage years trapped in boredom, I would regret it later. That decision helped me become stronger emotionally. My teenage years were not perfect, but they taught me resilience.

            <h2>College Experience</h2>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My <b><i>college experience </i></b>, especially here in UE, has been very exciting because everything is new. I am surrounded by a new environment, new people, and new faces. Adjusting to college life felt like stepping into a completely different world. I also experienced a bit of culture shock because things here are different from my previous school. In my first year, everything went smoothly since I enrolled in the course I wanted, which is Computer Science. Every day, I looked forward to learning new things that would improve my skills. Laboratory sessions were especially exciting because I could apply what I learned in real life. I also got the chance to work with new classmates and make friends. Making a new circle of friends made my days feel more enjoyable. Some days were challenging because the workload was heavier than I expected. I had to learn how to manage my time properly to keep up with deadlines. I also discovered that group projects could be stressful but rewarding. Meeting different professors taught me how to adapt to different teaching styles. There were moments when I felt overwhelmed, but I learned to stay focused. College life also taught me independence in making decisions. I started joining activities that helped me grow personally and socially. Every semester, I faced challenges that pushed me to become better. I began understanding the career path I wanted for my future. Even though some days were tiring, I felt proud of my progress. My college journey shaped me into a more responsible and confident person. Looking back, I am grateful for the lessons, friendships, and experiences that college has given me so far.
