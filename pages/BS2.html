        <h2>Worth It?</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes, you just stop and ask yourself:
            <strong>“is it even worth it anymore?"</strong> At first, I thought IT was just about coding and computers.
            The sleepless nights, the endless deadlines, the coffee that barely works, and the constant pressure to perform. High grades sound great on paper, but behind them are late nights staring at a screen, forcing productivity even when the brain is already exhausted. At some point, it stops feeling like ambition and starts feeling like survival mode.

        <h2>The Cost of Grades</h2>
        <p>
            Everyone says grades matter. That they open doors, define success, and secure the future. But no one really talks about the cost. The burnout. The anxiety. The feeling of guilt when you rest, like you’re wasting time. You start measuring your worth by numbers on a screen, and when those numbers drop, so does your confidence. Kahit alam mong you’re more than your grades, it’s hard not to feel defeated.

        <h2>Constant Pressure</h2>
        <p>
            What makes it worse is the pressure to always be “doing more.” Sleep less, work harder, grind nonstop. Rest feels like a luxury instead of a necessity. Passion turns into obligation, and learning becomes something you rush through just to survive the next requirement. Nakakapagod maging strong all the time.

        <p>
            This is why I want to be someone who protects systems instead of breaking them.
            Gusto kong matutunan kung paano mag-secure ng data at networks.
            Para sa akin, cybersecurity feels like being a digital guard—quiet but extremely important.

        <h2>Burnout vs Success</h2>
        <p>
            Maybe the real question isn’t whether high grades are worth it, but whether losing yourself in the process is. Success shouldn’t mean being constantly tired, anxious, and empty. Maybe it’s okay to slow down. Maybe balance is also a form of achievement. Because at the end of the day, what’s the point of winning if you’re already burned out?
