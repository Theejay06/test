      <h1>Life Before AI</h1>
      <p>Blog Story Part 1 – Reflection</p>

      Life before AI was slower, quieter, and more personal. People relied on their minds,
      memories, and handwritten notes instead of instant answers. Mistakes were harder to fix,
      but lessons stuck longer because learning took time. Work and research required more effort,
      patience, and direct interaction with books and other people.

      Before AI, discovering information required accuracy, energy, patience, and effort.
      Finding answers meant reading many articles, watching documentaries, and asking others.
      Today, AI has changed how we learn. Fast replies and direct answers are now available.
      Students and researchers can ask AI questions casually and even train it to respond
      the way they want.

      To conclude, AI has made life easier and more efficient. Because it is developing so fast,
      people must learn how to adapt and use it properly. One important question remains:
      how should AI be used responsibly?
