        <h2>The Start of My Journey</h2>
        <p>
            Ever since I started studying technology, one question keeps popping into my head:
            <strong>“Saan ba talaga ako papunta?”</strong> At first, I thought IT was just about coding and computers.
            But habang mas lumalalim ang exposure ko sa tech world, mas naging malinaw sa akin na gusto kong pumasok
            sa mas challenging at exciting fields—Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, at kahit sa world ng
            crypto at trading.

            This blog is about my career goals, my interests, and how I see myself growing in the future tech industry.
        </div>

        <h2>Why I’m Drawn to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            One reason why AI interests me is because it feels like the future is already happening now.
            Nakikita ko kung paano ginagamit ang AI sa daily life—chatbots, recommendations, automation,
            and decision-making. As a student, na-eexcite ako sa idea na someday, I can help build systems
            that think, learn, and adapt.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don’t just want to use AI tools; I want to understand how they work behind the scenes.
            For me, AI is not about replacing humans but helping people work smarter and solve problems faster.
        </p>

        <h2>Cybersecurity: Protecting the Digital World</h2>
        <p>
            Another field I really want to pursue is cybersecurity. Habang mas nagiging digital ang mundo,
            mas dumarami rin ang threats—hacking, data breaches, scams, at identity theft.
            Nakakatakot isipin na isang maliit na vulnerability lang can cause massive damage.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is why I want to be someone who protects systems instead of breaking them.
            Gusto kong matutunan kung paano mag-secure ng data at networks.
            Para sa akin, cybersecurity feels like being a digital guard—quiet but extremely important.
        </p>

        <h2>Exploring the World of Crypto and Trading</h2>
        <p>
            Aside from AI and cybersecurity, curious din ako sa crypto and trading world.
            At first, akala ko puro hype lang siya, but the more I learn, the more I realize
            na may deep connection ito sa technology, security, and even psychology.
        </p>

        <p>
            Trading teaches discipline, risk management, and emotional control.
            I know it’s risky, but I see it as a field where knowledge and strategy matter more than luck.
        </p>

        <h2>Growth Over Comfort</h2>
        <p>
            Looking ahead, I see my future career revolving around AI, cybersecurity, and emerging technologies
            like crypto. I know the path won’t be easy—maraming aaralin, maraming failures, at maraming moments
            ng self-doubt.
        </p>

        <p>
            My biggest takeaway is this: <strong>the tech world rewards those who never stop learning</strong>.
            My goal is not just to land a job, but to build skills that matter and make an impact.
